% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V2.1 April 2013
% This file should be compiled with V2.5 of "sig-alternate.cls" May 2012
%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

\title{High Concurreny B-Trees for Insert Heavy Workloads}
\subtitle{An in-depth comparison}
%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{2} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.
%
\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

You should try to write the best research paper that you can using the results of your project. You have read many good papers throughout this class, so by this point you should have a good idea of what makes a good research paper! Basically, your report needs to clearly present the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the problem statement
\item The motivation, why its important
\item The literature review (the previous work in this area
\item Main idea and approach
\item Implementatino techniques
\item Experimental setup
\item Results
\end{enumerate}

\section{Introduction}

\section{Previous Work}
B-trees have long been the primary access data structure for databases, file systems, and various other systems because of their logarthimc \texttt{insert()} and \texttt{get()}.
They also have a host of other properties that make them also for large systems.  A short list: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Maintain everything inorder.  This means that merge operations can be done without sort, and SMJ, and often used join in database systems, is very efficent
\item Block access.  The strucutre can store as much data is it can on a single page, and doing locking on a single page.  This made B-Tree's very popular early on, when database's could not fit in memory, and had to be dumped onto disk.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Plans}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Terminology: B+ Tree vs B*Trees
\item 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Architecture}
What all did we have to build to make this work and test out our ideas?
\begin{itemize}
  \item{Testing Framework:} We want to test the system at different levels of
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Input Size
      \item Number of THreads
      \item Read Write Percent Workload
      \item Fannout on inner nodes
      \item Data slots on leaf nodes
    \end{itemize}
    To testing all of these things, I will be creating a dope ass main.ccp that can read input from test ases
  \item{Sequential Tree:} We had to build a simple, single-thread B-tree first.  We built on this for our other version, and will also use it as the baseline for testing.
  \item{ReaderWriter Tree:} This tree uses different kinds of locks, shared and exclusive, and also does checking to see if the child node can split, to see if this node is "safe" from splitting
  \item{LockingFree Tree:} I think I'm about to start this
  \item{BLink Tree:} This structure is different in that it insert into the leaf node, and acquires locks on the way back up
\end{itemize}


\section{Citations}
Some papers that we read to give ourselves background on the topics:
\begin{itemize}
  \item "Concurrent B-trees with Lock-free Techniques"\cite{sultana:lockfree} gives us the inspiration for the lock free B-tree.  They, however, didn't not have access to the large memory, built in C++14 atomics, and they were not focusing on writes - they were trying to build a general purpose lock free btree for NUMA computers.
  \item "A survey of B-tree locking techniques"\cite{graefe:survey}, much like the title says, presents an over of many of the different approaches that have been taken so far.  However, it reallys skims over, almost dismissing, lock free techniques.
  \item "Efficient Locking for Concurrent Operations on B-Trees" \cite{lehman:locking} This one gave us the idea of the \texttt{can\_split()} function, and gave background on reader writer locks and other, etc
  \item "Concurrent Cache-Oblivious B-Trees" \cite{bender:cache} I need to read this one again
  \item "A Concurrent Blink-Tree Algorithm Using a Cooperative Locking Protocl" \cite{lim:blink} Ryan is making this verion
\end{itemize}

\section{Experimental Results}
We will need some tables.  I have some data from the sequential tree
