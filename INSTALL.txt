Before you attempt to run this code, first make sure you have a complier with full C++14 support.
We used gcc 4.9.3, but anything 4.9 or later should work.

Then, simply navigate to whichever directory you'd like and type 'make'.
The B-Tree implmentations are in
  -sequential
  -reader_writer_lock_list
  -reader_writer_lock_array
  -stl

Each of these folder has its own makefiles, and is self contained.  
It you'd like to switch to debug mode, you can open the Makefiles and change the release flag.
